# Rock vs Mine Prediction Using Machine Learning

## üìö Project Overview

This project leverages **machine learning** techniques to classify sonar signals as either **rock** or **mine**. The dataset used for this project is sourced from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** and contains signal data collected by bouncing sonar waves off rocks or mines. The objective is to build and evaluate a predictive model that can distinguish between the two categories effectively.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Efficient Preprocessing:** Data normalization and preparation ensure high model performance.
- **Binary Classification:** Accurate detection of whether a sonar signal corresponds to a rock or a mine.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluation of the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Modular Implementation:** All steps, from data loading to predictions, are documented in a structured Jupyter Notebook.

## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Load and normalize the sonar dataset.
   - Split data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Perform basic statistical analysis and visualize feature distributions.

### 3. **Model Training**
   - Train the model using algorithms like Logistic Regression or Decision Trees.
   - Optimize hyperparameters to improve classification performance.

### 4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Use metrics like confusion matrix, accuracy, and F1-score to assess model performance.

### 5. **Predictions**
   - Test the model with new sonar data to classify inputs as "Rock" or "Mine."
